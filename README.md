Beks has come a long way since her first day at that boot camp five years ago—and since earlier this week, when she started learning about neural networks! Now, she is finally ready to put her skills to work to help the foundation predict where to make investments.

With your knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, you’ll use the features in the provided dataset to help Beks create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.


## Results: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions.

#### Data Preprocessing

#### What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?


#### What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?


#### What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?


### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

### How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?

### Were you able to achieve the target model performance?


### What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?


### Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
