# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis-
Beks has come a long way since her first day at that boot camp five years agoâ€”and since earlier this week, when she started learning about neural networks! Now, she is finally ready to put her skills to work to help the foundation predict where to make investments.

With our knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, we'll use the features in the provided dataset to help Beks create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. Our goal is to build a deep neural network that will yield accurate predicitions of success by ingesting the dataset.


## Results: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions.

### Data Preprocessing

### Target Variable
After reviewing the dataset, we consider IS_SUCCESSFUL as the target variable of the neural network. The overall goal of the machine learning process is to determine whether or not the charity donation was used effectively. Our belief is that the binary data in this variable indicate success.


### Model Features
We consider the following variables as features in our neural network model:

- APPLICATION_TYPE
- AFFILIATION
- CLASSIFICATION
- USE_CASE
- ORGANIZATION
- STATUS
- INCOME_AMT
- SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS
- ASK_AMT

### Irrelevant variable(s)

We consider the following variables irrelevant to our model and have removed them:

- NAME
- EIN

## Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

### Amount of neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?


### Were you able to achieve the target model performance?

According to our accuracy output below, we were not able to achieve the 80% target accuracy in our neural network model. 

```
268/268 - 1s - loss: 0.5881 - accuracy: 0.7054 - 504ms/epoch - 2ms/step
Loss: 0.5880504250526428, Accuracy: 0.7054227590560913
```

### What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?

In order to improve accuracy, we took the following measures to modify the model:

- Dropped the following additional columns: ORGANIZATION
- Decreased the value cutoff for the application_type_counts bins from 10000 -> 500
- Decreased the value cutoff for the classification_counts bins from 5000 -> 1000
- Doubled the amount of neurons in each hidden layer
- Added a third hidden layer
- Decreased the number of epochs to 50
- Changed the activation to tanh

We were able to improve the accuracy of the neural network model, unfortunately still not enouh to hit our 80% target:

```
268/268 - 0s - loss: 0.5656 - accuracy: 0.7221 - 462ms/epoch - 2ms/step
Loss: 0.565593421459198, Accuracy: 0.7220991253852844
```

### Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
